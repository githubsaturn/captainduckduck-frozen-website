CaptainDuckDuck has built-in support for Let's Encrypt and it enables you to easily put your websites behind secure HTTPS without being concerned with the cost of SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt is free) and without any hassle of setting up configs and renewing certificates.

## Enable HTTPS on Captain:

One of the benefits of Captain, is the ONE CLICK HTTPS activation. Simply click on Enable HTTPs on your dashboard and after a couple of seconds your HTTPS is enabled. Note that once HTTPS is enabled, you cannot change your root domain, i.e. `something.mydomain.com`, of course it's always possible to re-install Captain and change it. After enabling HTTPS, you can optionally, although very recommended, enforce HTTPS for all requests, i.e. denying plain insecure HTTP connections and redirect them to HTTPS. Make sure you manually check HTTPS before doing this. Simply go to `https://captain.something.mydomain.com` and if it works, you can safely force HTTPS.

## Enable HTTPS for Apps:

You have full control over enabling HTTPS on your own apps. Once Captain root HTTPS is enabled, you can enable HTTPS for individual apps. To do so, simply go to Captain web, select Apps from the left side menu, scroll to your desired app, and click on Enable HTTPS. That's it!
